## About The Project

This simple game app was created during my time in the web development bootcamp. I created this game during the time I am learning HTML, CSS, and the basics of Javascript. Since I still don't have any knowledge of different frameworks, all of the functionalities, and features, and styling in this game app was done only pure javascript codes, vanilla CSS and of course the plain old HTML. This project was created for me to experience developing a game app, and to practice the learnings I have acquired related to javascript.

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- ReactJS
- Material UI
- Threejs
